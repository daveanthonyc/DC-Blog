# My blog created in Astro

This is my first time using Astro. I've always liked the experience of creating documentation in my GitHub projects and having this blog template in Astro allowed me to focus on the writing insted of having to worry about the blog implementation.

# Installation
```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template blog
```
